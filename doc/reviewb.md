8. COCOMO is a parametric effort estimation methods
      - What is the central intuition of the COCOMO equation?
      - Write down the COCOMO equation (hint: it should fit in half a line)
      - What are the for "P" of the COCOMO attributes? Give one example of each "P"
      - In COCOMO co-effecients are shown above, what is `acap` ? What happens to project development effort when it is increased? Why?
      - In COCOMO co-effecients are shown above, what is `cplx` ? What happens to project development effort when it is increased? Why?
      - From the above parameters, find how much faster a fully distributed system compared to a fully
centralized site. If needed, you may assume that the system has 100,000 lines of code.
9.    What is delphi based method? 
       - Why use it instead of COCOMO?
10.    "Planning poker" is  strategy is suitable for group discussion effort estimation environment
      -  Describe this approach plus one advantage and one disadvantage of using this method.
11.    What is no estimate method? When might it be s necessary? 
12.    Case base reasoning is called a non-parametric method.
      - Why? Hint: your answer will have to describe how it works
      - Give  2 advantages and disadvantages of CBR.
      - Given the following project data, what estimate would case-based reasoning assign to the last row? Note that the words
        in t

|analyst capability|multi-site development |use of tools| product complexity| khours(estimate)|
|--|-|-|--|---|

## Requirements

![](http://www.isa.us.es/sites/www.isa.us.es.featuremodelanalysis/files/images/MobilePhone.png)

1.   Consider the above feature model of a mobile phone. What features are allowed and forbidden in this diagram?
2.   Consider the design of a car. Every car has a body, transmission, and engine. 
     A car does not necessarily have a trailer. The engine may be powered with gasoline or with electricity or with both. Draw a feature model for car.
2.   A client has asked you to develop a word processor. 
     - Write two non functional requirements for this scenario.
       For each, list factors that make them easier or harder to fill
     - List two functional requirements
       For each, list factors that make them easier or harder to fill
